## Overview
----------
In this project I created a Python script in Jupyter Notebook to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news outlets using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning).  VADER is sensitive to negative, positive, and neutral sentiment and also works out the compound sentiment value to indicate *overall sentiment polarity*.
 
The final output is a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by @BBCNews, @CNNbrk (CNN Breaking News), @CBSNews , @FOXNews, and @NYTimes on December 1, 2017.
